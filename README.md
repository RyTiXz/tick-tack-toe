# tick-tack-toe
This project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum, where I built a classic TicTacToe game. The project focuses on applying factory functions and module patterns to structure the code and separate game logic from user interface manipulation.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Play a game of TicTacToe between two players.
Dynamic game board displayed in the browser.
The game detects wins, losses, and ties.
Reset the game board to play again.
Clear separation between game logic and display.
ðŸš€ Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the game board and elements.
CSS3: For styling the game board and visual layout.
JavaScript (ES6): For the game logic, player handling, and DOM manipulation.
